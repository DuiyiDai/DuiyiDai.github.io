Hi, I am a Researcher in Data Science and Informatics at the [Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science](https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford, where I work with [Charles Rahal](https://crahal.com/). I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Birmingham in 2025. I was supervised by [Prof. Robert Elliott](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/business/elliott-robert) and [Dr. Wanyu Chung](https://sites.google.com/site/wanyuchung/).

My research interests are in the fields of media economics, environmental economics, macroeconomics, political economy, machine learning, and deep learning.
